## FAQ

#### What is the point of this?
I feel most people on 4chan are incapable of not falling for bait, flamewars, forced memes and blatant shilling so I've created this list to help them have a better time on 4chan. 

#### Why are you filtering so many things? Isn't it a bit too much?
These are so many things that are posted every single day by people who think repeating the same thing over and over again like a broken record is funny. Also, some of it is blatant advertising/shilling and it baffles me that 4chan's staff does not delete it.

#### My board index has significantly less threads after applying this filter.
I believe in quality over quantity. If there are things you wish exempted from the filter on your end, delete the lines you don't want or enter a # symbol before each line.

#### What about freedom of speech?
I am a supporter of freedom of speech. You can and should be able to say whatever you want. People also have a right to ignore you if they so choose however and luckily, 4chanX and other userscripts that support regex filtering allows them to do so automatically and without much hassle. Your posts are not being deleted from 4chan as a result of this filter list and it's likely that most people will never see or use it, so they'll still be seen by the vast majority of users.

#### Why did you filter so many right-wing lines/terms/whatever? Is there a political motive behind this?
No, I am not part of any political movement nor do I have a political stance on most things, frankly I think it's a waste of time. As you've noticed I've also filtered left-wing ones. I've also excluded these terms from being filtered on /pol/ which is where you should discuss politics and there's zero reason to do it on other boards.

#### What's the criteria for submitting suggestions?
If you see a recurring offtopic, bait, shill or whatever post that's posted frequently (check archives like desuarchive, nyafuu etc. to make sure that's the case) and submit a pull request along with an archive link of your findings. You may also submit pull requests to correct my bad/sub-optimal regex as I'm not particularly good at it. If there are any issues with the filter's functionality, submit it as an issue and I'll have a look at it.
